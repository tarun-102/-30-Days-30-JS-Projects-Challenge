# 🧠 30 Days 30 JavaScript Projects Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript learning journey**!  
In this repository, I will be building **30 different JavaScript projects in 30 days** — one project every day.  
The goal is to revise all important JS concepts with real-world mini projects. 💡

## 🔥 What is This Challenge?

I already know JavaScript basics, but I was feeling a little rusty.  
So, I created this challenge to build small projects daily and make my concepts crystal clear.  
By the end of 30 days, I aim to be **100% confident in JavaScript**.
