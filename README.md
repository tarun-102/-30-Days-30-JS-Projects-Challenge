# 🧠 30 Days 30 JavaScript Projects Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript learning journey!**  
In this repository, I will build **30 JavaScript projects in 30 days** — one small project every day.  
The goal is to revise all important JS concepts with hands-on practice. 💪

## 🔥 What is This Challenge?

I already know JavaScript basics, but I was feeling a little rusty.  
So, I started this challenge to **re-learn by building** — because the best way to learn is by doing.  
By the end of 30 days, I aim to be **100% confident in JavaScript**.
